# replication code of group 6
Here you can find the code we used to perform out replication research, along with the logs of our experiments.

In the zip folders named literal_replication_part1.zip and literal_replication_part2.zip you can find our logs and generated images, regarding our literal replication.

In the cifar10_experiment.zip you can find the code we created in order to run the failed experiments for the cifar10 dataset and the logs of all our trainings. If you want to run the experiments you need to manually download the Cifar10 dataset, merge train and test folders into a single folder named "cifar10" and place it into a folder named "data", inside the main direction of HC-MGAN. Also, in this zip file we have included the repl.yaml file, which contains the requirement packages for the anaconda environment we used.
